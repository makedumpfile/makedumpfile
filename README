=======================

* REQUIREMENTS
  Please download the following library file and install it exactly as below;
  do NOT use "make install".

  - elfutils-0.144.tar.gz

    The "make install" of elfutils installs some commands (ld, readelf, etc.),
    and compiling problems sometimes happen due to using the installed
    commands. To install only the library & header files, use the following
    method:

     # tar -zxvf elfutils-0.144.tar.gz
     # cd elfutils-0.144
     # ./configure
     # make
     #
     # mkdir /usr/local/include/elfutils/
     # cp ./libdw/libdw.h   /usr/local/include/elfutils/libdw.h
     # cp ./libdwfl/libdwfl.h /usr/local/include/elfutils/libdwfl.h
     # cp ./libdw/dwarf.h   /usr/local/include/dwarf.h
     # cp ./libelf/libelf.h /usr/local/include/libelf.h
     # cp ./libelf/gelf.h   /usr/local/include/gelf.h
     #
     # cp ./libelf/libelf.a /usr/local/lib/libelf.a
     # cp ./libdw/libdw.a   /usr/local/lib/libdw.a
     # cp ./libasm/libasm.a /usr/local/lib/libasm.a
     # cp ./libebl/libebl.a /usr/local/lib/libebl.a

* BUILD & INSTALL
  1.Get the latest makedumpfile from the following site:
    https://github.com/makedumpfile/makedumpfile

  2.Uncompress the tar file:
    # tar -zxvf makedumpfile-x.y.z.tar.gz

  3.Enter the makedumpfile subdirectory:
    # cd makedumpfile-x.y.z

  4.Build, and install:
    # make; make install

  - Build with dynamic libraries, without -static option:
    $ make LINKTYPE=dynamic

  - Build for a different architecture than the host:
    # make TARGET=<arch> ; make install
    where <arch> is the 'uname -m' of the target architecture. 
    The user has to set the environment variable CC to appropriate
    compiler for the target architecture.

  - Build with lzo support:
    # make USELZO=on ; make install
    The user has to prepare lzo library.

  - Build with snappy support:
    # make USESNAPPY=on ; make install
    The user has to prepare snappy library.

  - Build with zstd support:
    # make USEZSTD=on ; make install
    The user has to prepare zstd library.

  - Build the extension module for --eppic option.
    # make eppic_makedumpfile.so
    The user has to prepare eppic library from the following site:
    http://code.google.com/p/eppic/

  #1    : Both kexec/kdump does not work with PPC64 2.6.20 kernels. 
          This is a known problem fixed with later kernels.
  #2    : kdump does not work with i386 sparsemem 2.6.27 kernels. 
          This is a known problem fixed with later kernels.
  **    : The deleted memory model.
          On x86_64, both FLATMEM and DISCONTIGMEM have been deleted since
          linux-2.6.25.

* USAGE
  Please see "man makedumpfile" or "makedumpfile -h".

* TODO
  1. Supporting more kernels.
  2. Fixing the report message.
     - Now, it sometimes counts the number of free_pages duplicating zero-pages
       if creating an ELF dumpfile.
     - The cyclic mode will show incorrect and many progress indicator.

* NOTE
  1. A vmcoreinfo file should be generated by the makedumpfile which is used
     for dump filtering. If installing the latest makedumpfile, the vmcoreinfo
     file should be regenerated by it. Actually, makedumpfile v1.2.0 or later
     cannot work by vmcoreinfo file which is generated by v1.1.9 or before.

  2. If using linux-2.6.24 and kexec-tools-testing-20061214, /proc/vmcore
     contains vmcoreinfo data. So it is possible to create a dumpfile without
     -x option (or -i option) like the following:
     # makedumpfile -d 31 /proc/vmcore dumpfile

  3. On makedumpfile-1.2.5 or before, both '--xen-syms' and '--xen-vmcoreinfo'
     excluded Xen user domain pages. Since makedumpfile-1.2.6, '-X' option
     have been added for excluding Xen user domain pages, and these options
     does not exclude Xen user domain pages. So user should specify '-X'
     option for excluding Xen user domain pages.

* FAQ
  001: If installing elfutils-0.137 into older elfutils by the above way, the
       following problem happens sometimes. If seeing, try to enable LDFLAGS
       comment (-L/usr/local/lib -I/usr/local/include) in Makefile.

       $ make
       [..]
       /tmp/ccXQtvnZ.o: In function `process_module':
       /makedumpfile/makedumpfile.c:1387: undefined reference to `dwarf_getelf'
       collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
       make: *** [makedumpfile] Error 1

  002: makedumpfile is compiled with -static option, because the command should
       run while the second kernel, which may not mount root filesystem and may
       not contain dynamic library files, is running.
       If the dynamic library files, which are needed by makedumpfile, exist
       while the second kernel is running, we can use dynamic libraries by 
       "LINKTYPE" parameter. 

       $ make LINKTYPE=dynamic

       This is a workaround for some linux distributions which does
       not contain static library files needed by makedumpfile.

  003: How can I verify the GPG signature of a tag?

       The public key to verify it is in the makedumpfile repository and
       tagged as "pubkey*":

         $ git tag | grep pubkey
         pubkey
         pubkey2
         pubkey3
         pubkey4

       As of September 2022, the pubkey4 is being used.
       You can import it and verify a tag like this:

         $ git cat-file blob pubkey4 | gpg --import
         $ git tag -v 1.7.1
